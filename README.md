# A Web Bluetooth polyfill for Chrome Apps

This polyfill has been removed.

It implemented an old version of the
[Web Bluetooth specification](https://webbluetoothcg.github.io/web-bluetooth/),
and is nearly unnecessary now that Web Bluetooth is supported on
[Android, ChromeOS, Linux and Mac](https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/web-bluetooth/blob/gh-pages/implementation-status.md),
including inside of Chrome Apps and Extensions.

If you're looking for the final version of the polyfill, you can find it tagged
